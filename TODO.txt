XXX add scorescreen to speedtest
X add MongoDB (may not need bluebird for what we are doing with user data and MongoDB)
X add user schema


add user auth
  - create login pages (signup and signin)
  - add password bcrypt hashing
  - add jwt token auth
  - allow navigation to any user page (ex: GET query username="jim"),
    but user can only administrate their own page


- transfer all the speedtest business logic to services


- add standard test (separate this from challenges)
- add user stats tracking

- add overall user stats
  - number of tests
  - total words typed
  - overall accuracy
  - overall wpm
  - etc.

- add more robust stats for speedtest:
  - keystrokes
  - accuracy
  - trouble words
  - trouble letters
